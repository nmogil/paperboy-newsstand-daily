# Authentication Changes

## Removed Email Authentication

We have removed email/password authentication from the application and now only support Google authentication.

### Changes Made:

1. **Auth Component Update**:

   - Removed email/password form fields
   - Removed signup/login toggle functionality
   - Only showing Google authentication button
   - Simplified UI for a cleaner authentication experience

2. **Supabase Configuration**:
   - Email authentication should be disabled through the Supabase Dashboard:
     - Go to Authentication > Providers
     - Turn off the Email provider
     - Make sure Google provider is enabled and properly configured

### Technical Notes:

- The client-side implementation no longer supports or references email/password authentication
- Google OAuth is the only authentication method available to users
- Existing users who signed up with email/password will need to use Google authentication going forward
- No database migrations were required as this is a configuration change at the Supabase auth level

### Why This Change:

- Simplifies the authentication flow
- Provides a more secure authentication method
- Reduces maintenance overhead
- Streamlines user experience
